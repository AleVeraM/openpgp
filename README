=== About OpenPGP

OpenPGP is the most widely-used e-mail encryption standard in the world. It
is defined by the OpenPGP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) Proposed Standard RFC 4880. The OpenPGP standard was originally
derived from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), first created by Phil Zimmermann in
1991.
